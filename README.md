This is the front end piece of a Movie recommendation engine that demonstrates the different results generated by various machine learning and correlation algorithms.

Users input a movie title and can generate recommendations based on pairwise correlation, SVG machine learning, or NMF machine learning. (Fastai options are in progress as well as a more robust front end with better text explaining the different options.)

(See https://github.com/meyermeyer/movie-recommender-back-end for Python back end.)
